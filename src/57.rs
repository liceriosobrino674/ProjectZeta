// This is just an example of how to create a simple Rust program. Feel free to modify it according to your specific needs.
// For this example, I am creating a basic program that adds two numbers and prints the result.

use std::io;

fn main() {
    let num1 = 42;
    let num2 = 36;

    // Add the two numbers
    let sum = num1 + num2;

    println!("The sum of {} and {} is {}", num1, num2, sum);
}
